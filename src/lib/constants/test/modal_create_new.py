  DESCRIPTION_LONG = u"""Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC)
    are three pillars that work together for the purpose of
    assuring that an organization meets its objectives. ...
    Governance is the combination of processes established '
    and executed by the board of directors that are '
    reflected in the organization's structure and how it '
    ismanaged and led toward achieving goals. Risk '
    management is predicting and managing risks that could '
    hinder the organization to achieve its objectives. '
    Compliance with the company's policies and procedures, '
    laws and regulations, strong and efficient governance is '
    considered key to an organization's success." [4] GRC '
    is a discipline that aims to synchronize information and '
    activity across governance, risk management and compliance '
    in order to operate more efficiently, enable effective '
    information sharing, more effectively report activities '
    and avoid wasteful overlaps. Although interpreted '
    differently in various organizations, GRC typically '
    encompasses activities such as corporate governance, '
    enterprise risk management (ERM) and corporate '
    compliance with applicable laws and regulations. '
    Organizations reach a size where coordinated control '
    over GRC activities is required to operate effectively. '
    Each of these three disciplines creates information of '
    value to the other two, and all three impact the same
    technologies, people, processes and information.
    Substantial duplication of tasks evolves when
    governance, risk management and compliance are managed
    independently. Overlapping and duplicated GRC activities
    negatively impact both operational costs and GRC metrics.
    For example, each internal service might be audited and
    assessed by multiple groups on an annual basis, creating
    enormous cost and disconnected results. A disconnected
    GRC approach will also prevent an organization from
    providing real-time GRC executive reports. Like a badly
    planned transport system, every individual route will
    operate, but the network will lack the qualities that
    allow them to work together effectively. If not
    integrated, if tackled in a traditional "silo" approach,
    most organizations must sustain unmanageable numbers of
    GRC-related requirements due to changes in technology,
    increasing data storage, market globalization and
    increased regulation. Un texte en français"""

  NOTES_LONG = u"""Governance describes the overall management approach
    through which senior executives direct and control the entire "
    organization, using a combination of management information "
    and hierarchical management control structures. Governance "
    activities ensure that critical management information "
    reaching the executive team is sufficiently complete, accurate "
    and timely to enable appropriate management decision making, "
    and provide the control mechanisms to ensure that strategies, "
    directions and instructions from management are carried out "
    systematically and effectively.[5] Governance of risk "
    management is the attention given to preventing excessive risk "
    management by keeping in mind the organisation's appetite for "
    risk. Sufficient countermeasures are required rather than "
    excessive, unnecessary and pointless measures. The risk of "
    risk management is that the good intentions become wasteful "
    expenditure or impediments to growth, innovation and "
    opportunity. Risk management is the set of processes through "
    which management identifies, analyzes, and, where necessary, "
    responds appropriately to risks that might adversely affect "
    realization of the organization's business objectives. The "
    response to risks typically depends on their perceived "
    gravity, and involves controlling, avoiding, accepting or "
    transferring them to a third party. Whereas organizations "
    routinely manage a wide range of risks (e.g. technological "
    risks, commercial/financial risks, information security risks "
    etc.), external legal and regulatory compliance risks are "
    arguably the key issue in GRC. Compliance means conforming "
    with stated requirements. At an organizational level, "
    it is achieved through management processes which identify the "
    applicable requirements (defined for example in laws, "
    regulations, contracts, strategies and policies), assess the "
    state of compliance, assess the risks and potential costs of "
    non-compliance against the projected expenses to achieve "
    compliance, and hence prioritize, fund and initiate any "
    corrective actions deemed necessary. Un texte en français"""
