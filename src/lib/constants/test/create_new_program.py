TEST_DESCRIPTION = u'"Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) are ' \
                   u'three pillars that work together for the purpose of ' \
                   u'assuring that an organization meets its objectives. ... ' \
                   u'Governance is the combination of processes established ' \
                   u'and executed by the board of directors that are ' \
                   u'reflected in the organization\'s structure and how it ' \
                   u'ismanaged and led toward achieving goals. Risk ' \
                   u'management is predicting and managing risks that could ' \
                   u'hinder the organization to achieve its objectives. ' \
                   u'Compliance with the company\'s policies and procedures, ' \
                   u'laws and regulations, strong and efficient governance is ' \
                   u'considered key to an organization\'s success." [4] GRC ' \
                   u'is a discipline that aims to synchronize information and ' \
                   u'activity across governance, risk management and compliance ' \
                   u'in order to operate more efficiently, enable effective ' \
                   u'information sharing, more effectively report activities ' \
                   u'and avoid wasteful overlaps. Although interpreted ' \
                   u'differently in various organizations, GRC typically ' \
                   u'encompasses activities such as corporate governance, ' \
                   u'enterprise risk management (ERM) and corporate ' \
                   u'compliance with applicable laws and regulations. ' \
                   u'Organizations reach a size where coordinated control ' \
                   u'over GRC activities is required to operate effectively. ' \
                   u'Each of these three disciplines creates information of ' \
                   u'value to the other two, and all three impact the same ' \
                   u'technologies, people, processes and information. ' \
                   u'Substantial duplication of tasks evolves when ' \
                   u'governance, risk management and compliance are managed ' \
                   u'independently. Overlapping and duplicated GRC activities ' \
                   u'negatively impact both operational costs and GRC metrics. ' \
                   u'For example, each internal service might be audited and ' \
                   u'assessed by multiple groups on an annual basis, creating ' \
                   u'enormous cost and disconnected results. A disconnected ' \
                   u'GRC approach will also prevent an organization from ' \
                   u'providing real-time GRC executive reports. Like a badly ' \
                   u'planned transport system, every individual route will ' \
                   u'operate, but the network will lack the qualities that ' \
                   u'allow them to work together effectively. If not ' \
                   u'integrated, if tackled in a traditional "silo" approach, ' \
                   u'most organizations must sustain unmanageable numbers of ' \
                   u'GRC-related requirements due to changes in technology, ' \
                   u'increasing data storage, market globalization and ' \
                   u'increased regulation. Un texte en français'
TEST_NOTES = u"Governance describes the overall management approach through " \
             u"which senior executives direct and control the entire " \
             u"organization, using a combination of management information " \
             u"and hierarchical management control structures. Governance " \
             u"activities ensure that critical management information " \
             u"reaching the executive team is sufficiently complete, accurate " \
             u"and timely to enable appropriate management decision making, " \
             u"and provide the control mechanisms to ensure that strategies, " \
             u"directions and instructions from management are carried out " \
             u"systematically and effectively.[5] Governance of risk " \
             u"management is the attention given to preventing excessive risk " \
             u"management by keeping in mind the organisation's appetite for " \
             u"risk. Sufficient countermeasures are required rather than " \
             u"excessive, unnecessary and pointless measures. The risk of " \
             u"risk management is that the good intentions become wasteful " \
             u"expenditure or impediments to growth, innovation and " \
             u"opportunity. Risk management is the set of processes through " \
             u"which management identifies, analyzes, and, where necessary, " \
             u"responds appropriately to risks that might adversely affect " \
             u"realization of the organization's business objectives. The " \
             u"response to risks typically depends on their perceived " \
             u"gravity, and involves controlling, avoiding, accepting or " \
             u"transferring them to a third party. Whereas organizations " \
             u"routinely manage a wide range of risks (e.g. technological " \
             u"risks, commercial/financial risks, information security risks " \
             u"etc.), external legal and regulatory compliance risks are " \
             u"arguably the key issue in GRC. Compliance means conforming " \
             u"with stated requirements. At an organizational level, " \
             u"it is achieved through management processes which identify the " \
             u"applicable requirements (defined for example in laws, " \
             u"regulations, contracts, strategies and policies), assess the " \
             u"state of compliance, assess the risks and potential costs of " \
             u"non-compliance against the projected expenses to achieve " \
             u"compliance, and hence prioritize, fund and initiate any " \
             u"corrective actions deemed necessary. Un texte en français"
